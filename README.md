# easyconfig

Easyconfig is a little library I created to prevent myself and my co-workers
from sharing sensitive config files on Github accidentally.

It simply generates a config file on first use from an object.

## Roadmap

I have some features in mind, feel free to implement them.

* Check if the file has a valid structure
* Prompt user to fill in configuration values using the console

I'll probably implement them on a rainy sunday night or whenever I need them some day.
